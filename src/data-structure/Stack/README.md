A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push and pop. Order of element to be inserted is last-in-first-out (LIFO) The usual push and pop operations are provided, as well as a method to peek at the top item on the stack, a method to test for whether the stack is empty.

**Acceptance criteria:**

1. When a stack is first created, it contains no items.
2. `isEmpty()` method to tests if this stack is empty.
3. `push(e)` method to push an item onto the top of this stack
4. `pop()` method to remove the element at the top of this stack and returns that element as the value of this function.
5. `peek()` method to look at the element at the top of this stack without removing it from the stack.
6. `toArray()` method to return array representation of a stack.
7. `toString()` method to return a string representation of a stack.

```javascript
class Stack {
  isEmpty()
  peek()
  pop()
  push(e)
  toArray()
  toString
}
```
